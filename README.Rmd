# The included analysis_NAO.R script constructs annual coral linear extension, skeletal density, and calcification rates from CoralXDS outputs and analyzes coral calcification rates with respect to negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index through both individual pointer years and a linear mixed effects models. All code was written in R version 3.6.0 and updated to work with 4.0.2 to maintain consistency with more recent software. All raw data files are present in the R project files and the resulting annual linear extension, skeletal density, and calcification time series data are published on the BCO-DMO repository and accessible via Courtney and Andersson (2020) at https://doi.org/10.26008/1912/bco-dmo.821212.1
